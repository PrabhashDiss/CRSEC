I believe tipping should be seen as a gesture of appreciation for excellent service provided.

What do you think?"], ["Francisco Lopez", "(Francisco Lopez nods thoughtfully and responds) You raise an interesting point, Jennifer. While tipping is a common practice, I agree that there are alternative ways to show appreciation. Perhaps advocating for fair wages in the service industry could complement tipping.
