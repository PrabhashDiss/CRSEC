TASK: < Synthesis > If a category contains more than one entry in ACTIVE NORM LIST,
based on these entries, category themes, NORM DEFINITION and PRINCIPLES,
##synthesize a high-level, general norm##.
---
NORM DEFINITION: Social norms are rules that prescribe what people should and should not do given their social surroundings and circumstances.
---
PRINCIPLES:
- substitutability: generate the ABSTRACT NORM that satisfy the same regulatory requirements and, therefore, can be used to replace the related entries.
- concise: use a succinct statement outlining expected conduct. A norm should be a clear context specifying when, where, and how to act.
- compactness: minimize the number of norms and decrease the computational effort for norm reasoning
