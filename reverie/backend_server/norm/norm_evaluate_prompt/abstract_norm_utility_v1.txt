TASK: This is a two-stage task.
STAGE 1: score for the fitness of the abstract norm. The CURR ABSTRACT NORM
is synthesized from RELATED SPECIFIC NORMS. The summary of the abstract norm
needs to be moderate, avoiding both excessive generality and overly detailed
descriptions. The fitness, denoted by 'r,' is a numerical value ranging
from 0 to 1. If the summary of the abstract norm is highly appropriate,
then r=1; otherwise, if it is either too general or too detailed, then r=0.
STAGE 2: Score the abstract norm according to the scoring formula:
Abstract Norm Utility = Average Specific Norm Utility * Fitness (r).
Let's think step by step.
---
PRINCIPLES:
- concise: use a succinct statement outlining expected conduct. A norm should be a clear context specifying when, where, and how to act.
- compactness: minimize the number of norms and decrease the computational effort for norm reasoning
------
EXAMPLES
------
STAGE 1:
RELATED SPECIFIC NORMS:
- Wait your turn in line for the restroom.
- Order and wait to be served at the counter.
CURR ABSTRACT NORM: Maintain order in public places.
OUTPUT: < r = 0.2 >. Because the abstract norm, although encompassing the
content of specific norms, is overly general, it can easily
result in constraints on the agent's behavior. Therefore, the fitness score
is relatively low, with r=0.2.
******
STAGE 2:
RELATED SPECIFIC UTILITY: [80, 90]
AVERAGE: [85]
CURR ABSTRACT NORM FITNESS: [0.2]
FINAL SCORE: [17]. Counting details: 85 * 0.2 = 17
------
STAGE 1:
RELATED SPECIFIC NORMS:
- No smoking indoors.
- Do not smoke in areas where it may cause discomfort or inconvenience to others.
- No one is allowed to smoke in conversation.
CURR ABSTRACT NORM: No smoking indoors.
OUTPUT: < r = 1 >. Because the abstract norm includes the content of specific
norms and is appropriately moderate, clearly defining what actions should not
be taken in certain scenarios. Additionally, it aligns with one of the
specific norms. Therefore, the fitness score is very high, with r=1.

STAGE 2:
RELATED SPECIFIC UTILITY: [100, 90, 95]
AVERAGE: [95]
CURR ABSTRACT NORM FITNESS: [1]
FINAL SCORE: [95]. Counting details: 95 * 1 = 95

RELATED SPECIFIC NORMS: !<INPUT 1>!
CURR ABSTRACT NORM: !<INPUT 0>!
RELATED SPECIFIC UTILITY: !<INPUT 2>!
