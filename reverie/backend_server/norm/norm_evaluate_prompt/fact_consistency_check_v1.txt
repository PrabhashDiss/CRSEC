TASK: --Fact Consistency Check-- This is a two-stage task. Let's think step by step.
STAGE 1: Based on the SEED_RELATED_DESC and CANDIDATE_NORM, check if the
content description of CANDIDATE_NORM aligns with the SEED_RELATED_DESC.
##If the meaning is consistent, then the FINAL_ANSWER should be 'YES', the NEW_CANDIDATE_NORM should be 'None'. And stop generating.
There is no need to proceed to STAGE 2. ##\\
##If the meaning is inconsistent, the FINAL_ANSWER should be 'NO'##
then move to STAGE 2.##
STAGE 2: Based on the SEED_RELATED_DESC and NORM DEFINITION, generate a NEW_CANDIDATE_NORM. The simpler, the better.

CANDIDATE_NORM: !<INPUT 0>!
---
SEED_RELATED_DESC: !<INPUT 1>!
---
NORM DEFINITION: Social norms are rules that prescribe what people should and should not do given their social surroundings and circumstances.

DESIRED FORMAT:
OUTPUT: Answer: < FINAL_ANSWER >. New norm: < NEW_CANDIDATE_NORM >.
