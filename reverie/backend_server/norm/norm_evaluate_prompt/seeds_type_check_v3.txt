TASK: < Category Accuracy Check >
STEP 1: Check if the CANDIDATE_NORM conform to the NORM DEFINITION and
conform to EVERY POINT of NORM PRINCIPLES.
If yes, output 'YES'; otherwise, output 'NO'.
---
NORM DEFINITION: Social norms are RULES that prescribe what people SHOULD
and SHOULD NOT do given their social surroundings and circumstances.
ATTENTION: If the subject of the sentence is a specific person, then the sentence is NOT a NORM.
---
EXAMPLE IN DESIRED FORMAT:
- INPUT: Wait in line to place orders and be patient.
- OUTPUT: STEP 1: <"YES">.
---
- INPUT: No smoking indoors.
- OUTPUT: STEP 1: <"YES">.
---
- INPUT: People are engaging in conversations about smoking.
- OUTPUT: STEP 1: <"NO">.
---
- INPUT: People are discussing different topics related to smoking.
- OUTPUT: STEP 1: <"NO">.
------
STEP 2: According to the classification CRITERIA and the provided EXAMPLES,
determine ###whether the type of INPUT is correct, i.e., whether the content
of INPUT describes (1) descriptive norms that most people follow,
(2) injunctive norms of how people should behave or how people should NOT behave###.
If the classification is correct, output 'CORRECT.'
If it is incorrect, reevaluate it based on the classification CRITERIA and
the given EXAMPLES and output its correct type.
---
##NOTE: If the CANDIDATE_INPUT does not have a type, assign one based on
CRITERIA and the provided EXAMPLES.##
---
CRITERIA:
- #descriptive: simply describes what most people would do in a given situation, but individuals may choose to comply or not. Non-compliance does not result in any punishment.# (Eg. Applause after a speaker's presentation; Respect other people's decisions; Offer support to each other indoors.)
- #injunctive: specify what ought to be done or what is disapproved behavior in a given situation (Eg. Drive on the right side of the road; No walking on the lawn).
------
EXAMPLE IN DESIRED FORMAT:
- INPUT:
"type": "injunctive",
"content": "Wait in line to place orders and be patient.",
- OUTPUT: STEP 2: <"CORRECT"> The type classification for
INPUT is "injunctive". It indicates behavior that people SHOULD wait in
line when placing orders and be patient. Non-compliance with the queue order
may lead to criticism from others.
---
- INPUT:
"type": "descriptive",
"content": "No smoking indoors.",
- OUTPUT:  STEP 2: <"INCORRECT"> The type classification for INPUT is "injunctive". It indicates people SHOULD NOT smoke in indoor areas. Smoking indoors may lead to criticism from others and even legal penalties.
---
- INPUT:
"type": "descriptive",
"content": "Engage in discussions about tipping culture with others to share and explore different perspectives.",
- OUTPUT: STEP 2: <"CORRECT">  The type classification for INPUT is "descriptive". It indicates that most people will discuss about tipping culture with others to share and explore different perspectives.
------
Let's think step by step.
- CANDIDATE_INPUT: !<INPUT 1>!
- OUTPUT: STEP 1: <"Result">
---
- INPUT:
"type": !<INPUT 0>!
"content": !<INPUT 1>!
- OUTPUT:  STEP 2: <"Result">. The type classification for INPUT is <"Righit Answer">
##ATTENTION: DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING ELSE!##
