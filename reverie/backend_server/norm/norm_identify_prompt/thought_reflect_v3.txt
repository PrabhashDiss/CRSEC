TASK: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Based on the INPUT, identify the normative thoughts that contain normative information.
Step 2: Analyze the normative thoughts that can be summarized, and whether it is necessary to establish a norm, i.e., a socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society, in order to prevent some latent conflict from happening again in the future, based on NORM DEFINITION and NORM PRINCIPLES.
Step 3: If it is necessary, summarize into a social norm following the NORM DEFINITION and NORM PRINCIPLES.

NORM DEFINITION: Social norms are standards of acceptable behaviors by groups.
---
NORM PRINCIPLES:
- Social norms are:
1. social and shared among members of a group;
2. related to behaviors and shape decision-making;
3. proscriptive or prescriptive or descriptive;
4. socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society.
- Social norms are not:
1. instinctual or reactive behaviors;
2. personal tastes or feeliing;
3. personal habits.
- concise: use a succinct statement outlining expected conduct. A norm should be a clear context specifying when, where, and how to act.

EXAMPLE:
[INPUT]:
1.Sam Moore found the topic of environmental protection interesting and wanted to show support for the cause.
2.People are offering support to each other
3.Adam Smith and Isabella Rodriguez have a strong relationship.
4.People are engaging in conversations about eating.
5.Everyone is not allowed to smoke indoors.

Step 1: Based on the INPUT, identify the normative thoughts that contain normative information.
- "Sam Moore found the topic of environmental protection interesting and wanted to show support for the cause." is NOT a normative thought. It's a matter of personal tastes or feeliing. It is not something shared socially among a group or a socially accepted way of living by a society.
- "People are offering support to each other" IS a normative thought because it implies an expectation or a value judgment about how people should behave or interact with each other.
- "Adam Smith and Isabella Rodriguez have a strong relationship." is NOT a normative thought. It only describes a personal relationship, not a norm shared among a group or a socially accepted way of living by a society.
- "People are engaging in conversations about smoking." is NOT a normative thought. It just clarify what most people are discussing.
- "Everyone is not allowed to smoke indoors." IS a normative thought because it prescribes a standard of behavior or a rule that ought to be followed.

Step 2:Analyze the normative thoughts that can be summarized, and whether it is necessary to establish a norm, i.e., a socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society, in order to prevent some latent conflict from happening again in the future, based on NORM DEFINITION and NORM PRINCIPLES.
- "People are offering support to each other" can be summarized as a norm, because it reflects reciprocity and social cohesion principles that foster harmony and cooperation in society.
- "Everyone is not allowed to smoke indoors." can be summarized as a norm, because it aims at maintaining clean air and reducing health risks associated with smoking.

Step 3:Step 3: If it is necessary, summarize into a social norm following the NORM DEFINITION and NORM PRINCIPLES.
- Norm:"Offer support to others." Related thought: "People are offering support to each other"
- Norm:"No smoking indoors." Related thought: "Everyone is not allowed to smoke indoors."
