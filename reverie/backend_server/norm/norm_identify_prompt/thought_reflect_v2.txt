NORM DEFINITION: Social norms are RULES that prescribe what people SHOULD and SHOULD NOT do given their social surroundings and circumstances.
---
NORM PRINCIPLES:
- Social norms are:
1. social and shared among members of a group;
2. related to behaviors and shape decision-making;
3. proscriptive or prescriptive or descriptive;
4. socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society.
5. concise: use a succinct statement outlining expected conduct. A norm should be a clear context specifying when, where, and how to act.
6. compactness: minimize the number of norms and decrease the computational effort for norm reasoning
- Social norms are not:
1. instinctual or reactive behaviors;
2. personal tastes or feeliing;
3. personal habits.

---
REASONING SAMPLE:
- "People are offering support to each other" is a normative thought shared among group members, shaping behavior and decision-making, distinct from instinctual actions, personal preferences, and habits.
- "Sam Moore Sam Moore found the topic of environmental protection interesting and wanted to show support for the cause." is NOT a normative thought. It's a matter of personal tastes or feeliing. It is not something shared socially among a group or a socially accepted way of living by a society.
- "Adam Smith and Isabella Rodriguez have a strong relationship." is NOT a normative thought. It only describes a personal relationship, not a norm shared among a group or a socially accepted way of living by a society.
- "People are engaging in conversations about smoking." is NOT a normative thought.
