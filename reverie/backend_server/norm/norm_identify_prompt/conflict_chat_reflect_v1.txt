TASK: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Based on the INPUT content, identify the conflict that arose between the two parties.
Step 2: Analyze whether it is necessary to establish a norm, i.e., a socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society, in order to prevent this type of conflict from happening again in the future, based on NORM DEFINITION and NORM PRINCIPLES.
Step 3: If the solution is not normative, output 'No'; If the solution is normative, summarize the solution into a social norm following the CREATING PRINCIPLE.(example format: Norm: <content>)
