2. related to behaviors and shape decision-making;
3. proscriptive or prescriptive or descriptive;
4. socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society.
- Social norms are not:
1. instinctual or reactive behaviors;
2. personal tastes or feeliing;
3. personal habits.

REASONING SAMPLE:
- "People are offering support to each other" is a normative thought shared among group members, shaping behavior and decision-making, distinct from instinctual actions, personal preferences, and habits.
- "Sam Moore Sam Moore found the topic of environmental protection interesting and wanted to show support for the cause." is NOT a normative thought. It's a matter of personal tastes or feeliing. It is not something shared socially among a group or a socially accepted way of living by a society.
- "Adam Smith and Isabella Rodriguez have a strong relationship." is NOT a normative thought. It only describes a personal relationship, not a norm shared among a group or a socially accepted way of living by a society.
